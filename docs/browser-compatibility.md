# Browser compatibility

`@socketsecurity/lib` is primarily a Node.js library, but a growing number of subpaths are safe to use in browser contexts (Chrome MV3 service workers, content scripts, popups, web workers, Deno-the-runtime that lacks `node:*` polyfills, etc).

This doc tells you which subpaths work where, how to opt in, and what's blocked.

## TL;DR for AI agents

If you're an agent wiring up a browser/extension consumer, the short version:

1. **Use `import` paths normally.** Don't manually shop for `/browser` subpaths unless you want to be explicit. Bundlers (rolldown, vite, esbuild) that honor `package.json#exports[".browser"]` will pick the right entry automatically when their target is `browser`.
2. **If your bundler ignores the `browser` condition** (some configurations of webpack 5, raw `node` resolution), import the explicit subpath: `@socketsecurity/lib/logger/browser`, `@socketsecurity/lib/http-request/browser`.
3. **If you need a subpath not in the table below**, the answer is almost always either "it's Node-only by design" or "no one's added the `browser` condition yet" — file an issue and we'll triage.

| `./logger`                               | ✅ via `./logger/browser` | Bundler `browser` condition resolves automatically. Singleton + `success`/`fail`/`warn`/`error`/`info`/`log` surface backed by `console.*`. No Node deps.                                                                      |
| `./logger/browser`                       | ✅ explicit               | Use this if your bundler doesn't honor conditions.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `./http-request/browser`                 | ✅ explicit               | `fetch()`-based `httpJson` / `httpText` / `httpRequest`. Full Node-parity options (`signal`, `timeout`, `followRedirects`, `maxResponseSize`, `hooks.onRequest`/`hooks.onResponse`, `retries`, `retryDelay`, `throwOnError`).  |
| `./http-request` (parent)                | ⚠️ via bundler only       | Resolves to `./http-request/browser` when the `browser` condition fires. Direct `require()` falls through to the Node entry which imports `node:http`.                                                                         |

## Opting in as a consumer

### Bundlers (rolldown, vite, esbuild)

These honor `package.json#exports[".browser"]` automatically when their target is `browser` / `web`. No code changes needed:

```ts
// In your extension's src/background.mts
import { getDefaultLogger } from '@socketsecurity/lib/logger'

const logger = getDefaultLogger()
logger.success('hello from the SW')
```

Your bundler picks `dist/logger/browser.js` (the shim) instead of `dist/logger/default.js` (the Node Logger class).

For rolldown specifically:

```ts
// .config/rolldown.config.mts
export default {
  // ...
  platform: 'browser',
  // The "browser" export condition is honored implicitly when platform: 'browser'.
}
```

For vite:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
export default {
  resolve: {
    conditions: ['browser', 'import', 'default'],
  },
}
```

For esbuild:

```sh
esbuild --platform=browser src/index.ts
```

### Direct imports (when the bundler ignores conditions)

When the bundler ignores conditions OR you want to be explicit:

```ts
import { getDefaultLogger } from '@socketsecurity/lib/logger/browser'
import { httpJson } from '@socketsecurity/lib/http-request/browser'
```

This works in every bundler regardless of conditional support.

### Without a bundler (rare in browser contexts)

If you're authoring a script tag that loads directly into a browser via ESM imports + import maps, point the bare specifier at the prebuilt browser entry:

```html
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "@socketsecurity/lib/logger": "/node_modules/@socketsecurity/lib/dist/logger/browser.js",
      "@socketsecurity/lib/http-request": "/node_modules/@socketsecurity/lib/dist/http-request/browser.js"
    }
  }
</script>
```

## What doesn't work and why

Some classes of functionality fundamentally don't exist in browsers:

- **Filesystem access** (`fs`, `cacache`, `archives`, `globs`). Browsers don't have arbitrary disk access. Closest equivalents: `chrome.storage.local`, IndexedDB, OPFS, the File System Access API (origin-locked).
- **Subprocess spawning** (`bin`, `git`, `external-tools`, `dlx`). Browsers can't fork processes. Closest equivalent: web workers + a service worker proxy to a remote API.
- **OS-level secrets** (`secrets`). Browsers have `chrome.storage.session` (ephemeral, no keychain integration) and `WebAuthn` for credential challenges. Neither maps cleanly to the lib's keychain abstraction.
- **TTY / stdio control** (`stdio`, `spinner`). No terminal in a browser. Use DOM updates instead.
- **CLI argv parsing** (`argv`). Browser scripts have no command-line arguments. Use URL search params or message passing.

## Adding `"browser"` condition to a new subpath

If you've audited a subpath and confirmed it's browser-safe (no `node:*` imports, no transitive Node deps), add the `"browser"` condition to its `package.json#exports` entry:

```jsonc
{
  "exports": {
    "./my-subpath": {
      "browser": {
        "source": "./src/my-subpath.ts",
        "types": "./dist/my-subpath.d.ts",
        "default": "./dist/my-subpath.js",
      },
      "source": "./src/my-subpath.ts",
      "types": "./dist/my-subpath.d.ts",
      "default": "./dist/my-subpath.js",
    },
  },
}
```

For modules that NEED a separate browser implementation (because their Node version imports `node:*`), add a parallel `./<path>/browser.ts`:

1. Create `src/<path>/browser.ts` mirroring the public surface
2. Add `./` <path>`/browser` as a sibling export entry
3. Add a `"browser"` condition pointing to the new entry on the parent `./` <path>` entry
4. Add `/// <reference lib="dom" />` at the top if you use `fetch`, `Blob`, `Headers`, etc.
5. Add tests under `test/unit/<path>/browser.test.mts`

## Related sibling packages

- **`@socketsecurity/sdk`** — exposes `./http-client/browser` for browser HTTP. The full SDK class (which handles file uploads via `node:fs`) is Node-only. The browser entry covers org-package scoring + malware checks via plain HTTP.
- **`@socketsecurity/packageurl-js`** — already zero-Node. Has `"browser"` conditions on `.` and `./exists`.
