## [3.0.3](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v3.0.3) - 2025-11-01

### Fixed

- **Critical: Node.js ESM/CJS interop completely fixed**: Disabled minification to ensure proper ESM named import detection
  - Root cause: esbuild minification was breaking Node.js ESM's CJS named export detection
  - Solution: Disabled minification entirely (`minify: false` in esbuild config)
  - Libraries should not be minified - consumers minify during their own build process
  - Unminified esbuild output uses clear `__export` patterns that Node.js ESM natively understands
  - Removed `fix-commonjs-exports.mjs` build script - no longer needed with unminified code
  - ESM imports now work reliably: `import { getDefaultLogger } from '@socketsecurity/lib/logger'`
  - Verified with real-world ESM module testing (`.mjs` files importing from CJS `.js` dist)

## [3.0.2](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v3.0.2) - 2025-11-01

### Fixed

- **Critical: Node.js ESM named imports from CommonJS**: Fixed build output to ensure Node.js ESM can properly detect named exports from CommonJS modules
  - Previously, esbuild's minified export pattern placed `module.exports` before variable definitions, causing "Cannot access before initialization" errors
  - Build script now uses `@babel/parser` + `magic-string` for safe AST parsing and transformation
  - Exports are now correctly placed at end of files after all variable definitions
  - Enables proper ESM named imports: `import { getDefaultLogger, Logger } from '@socketsecurity/lib/logger'`
  - Fixes socket-cli issue where named imports were failing with obscure initialization errors

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v3.0.1) - 2025-11-01

### Added

- **Convenience exports from main index**: Added logger and spinner exports to ease v2→v3 migration
  - Logger: `getDefaultLogger()`, `Logger`, `LOG_SYMBOLS` now available from `@socketsecurity/lib`
  - Spinner: `getDefaultSpinner()`, `Spinner` now available from `@socketsecurity/lib`
  - Both main index (`@socketsecurity/lib`) and subpath (`@socketsecurity/lib/logger`, `@socketsecurity/lib/spinner`) imports now work
  - Both import paths return the same singleton instances

### Fixed

- **Critical: Spinner crashes when calling logger**: Fixed spinner internal calls to use `getDefaultLogger()` instead of removed `logger` export
  - Spinner methods (`start()`, `stop()`, `success()`, `fail()`, etc.) no longer crash with "logger is not defined" errors
  - All 5 internal logger access points updated to use the correct v3 API
  - Resolves runtime errors when using spinners with hoisted variables

### Changed

- **Migration path improvement**: Users can now import logger/spinner from either main index or subpaths, reducing breaking change impact from v3.0.0

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v3.0.0) - 2025-11-01

### Added

- Theme system with 5 built-in themes: `socket`, `sunset`, `terracotta`, `lush`, `ultra`
- `setTheme()`, `getTheme()`, `withTheme()`, `withThemeSync()` for theme management
- `createTheme()`, `extendTheme()`, `resolveColor()` helper functions
- `onThemeChange()` event listener for theme reactivity
- `link()` function for themed terminal hyperlinks in `@socketsecurity/lib/links`
- Logger and spinner now inherit theme colors automatically
- Spinner methods: `enableShimmer()`, `disableShimmer()`, `setShimmer()`, `updateShimmer()`
- DLX cross-platform binary resolution (`.cmd`, `.bat`, `.ps1` on Windows)
- DLX programmatic options aligned with CLI conventions (`force`, `quiet`, `package`)

### Changed

- Theme context uses AsyncLocalStorage instead of manual stack management
- Promise retry options renamed: `factor` → `backoffFactor`, `minTimeout` → `baseDelayMs`, `maxTimeout` → `maxDelayMs`

### Removed

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

- `pushTheme()` and `popTheme()` - use `withTheme()` or `withThemeSync()` instead
- `logger` export - use `getDefaultLogger()` instead
- `spinner` export - use `getDefaultSpinner()` instead
- `download-lock.ts` - use `process-lock.ts` instead
- Promise option aliases: `factor`, `minTimeout`, `maxTimeout`

  - Improves reliability when parsing complex package specs
  - Better handles edge cases in version ranges and scoped packages
  - Falls back to simple parsing if npm-package-arg fails

### Fixed

- **Scoped package version parsing**: Fixed critical bug where parsePackageSpec was stripping the `@` prefix from scoped packages with versions

  - Added `checksum_algorithm` field (currently "sha256")
  - Restructured to use `source.type` and `source.url` for origin tracking
  - Maintains backward compatibility in `listDlxCache()` reader

## [2.9.1](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v2.9.1) - 2025-10-30

### Added

- **Smart binary detection in dlxPackage**: Automatically finds the correct binary even when package name doesn't match binary name
  - If package has single binary, uses it automatically regardless of name
  - Resolves packages like `@socketsecurity/cli` (binary: `socket`) without manual configuration
  - Falls back to intelligent name matching for multi-binary packages
- **Optional binaryName parameter**: Added `binaryName` option to `DlxPackageOptions` for explicit binary selection when auto-detection isn't sufficient

### Fixed

- **Binary resolution for scoped packages**: Fixed issue where `dlxPackage` couldn't find binaries when package name didn't match binary name (e.g., `@socketsecurity/cli` with `bin: { socket: '...' }`)

  - References npm/cli v11.6.2 implementation for consistency

## [2.7.0](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v2.7.0) - 2025-10-28

### Added

- **DLX cache locking for concurrent installation protection**: Added process-lock protection to dlx-package installation operations
  - Lock file created at `~/.socket/_dlx/<hash>/.lock` (similar to npm npx's `concurrency.lock`)

  - Uses 5-second stale timeout and 2-second periodic touching (aligned with npm npx)
  - Double-check pattern verifies installation after acquiring lock to avoid redundant work
  - Completes 100% alignment with npm's npx locking strategy

## [2.6.0](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v2.6.0) - 2025-10-28

### Changed

- **Process locking aligned with npm npx**: Enhanced process-lock module to match npm's npx locking strategy

  - Synchronous and asynchronous variants for different use cases
  - Integrates with existing binary resolution utilities

## [2.2.1](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v2.2.1) - 2025-10-28

### Fixed

- **Logger write() method**: Fixed `write()` to bypass Console formatting when outputting raw text
  - Previously, `write()` used Console's internal `_stdout` stream which applied unintended formatting like group indentation
  - Now stores a reference to the original stdout stream in a dedicated private field (`#originalStdout`) during construction
  - The `write()` method uses this stored reference to write directly to the raw stream, bypassing all Console formatting layers
  - Ensures raw text output without any formatting applied, fixing test failures in CI environments where writes after `indent()` were unexpectedly formatted

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v2.2.0) - 2025-10-28

### Added

  - Automatic stripping of existing symbols from step messages
  - Maintains existing blank line behavior for clear step separation

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v2.1.0) - 2025-10-28

### Added

- Package manager detection utilities (`detectPackageManager()`, `getPackageManagerInfo()`, `getPackageManagerUserAgent()`)
- `isInSocketDlx()` utility to check if file path is within `~/.socket/_dlx/`
- `downloadPackage()` and `executePackage()` functions for separate download and execution of packages

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v2.0.0) - 2025-10-27

### Breaking Changes

**Environment Variable System Refactor**

This release completely refactors the environment variable system, consolidating 60+ individual env constant files into grouped getter modules with AsyncLocalStorage-based test rewiring.

**Consolidated env files** - Individual files replaced with grouped modules:
- `env/github.ts` - All GitHub-related env vars (GITHUB_TOKEN, GH_TOKEN, GITHUB_API_URL, etc.)
- `env/socket.ts` - Socket-specific env vars (SOCKET_API_TOKEN, SOCKET_CACACHE_DIR, etc.)
- `env/socket-cli.ts` - Socket CLI env vars (SOCKET_CLI_API_TOKEN, SOCKET_CLI_CONFIG, etc.)
- `env/npm.ts` - NPM-related env vars
- `env/locale.ts` - Locale env vars (LANG, LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES)
- `env/windows.ts` - Windows-specific env vars (USERPROFILE, LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, COMSPEC)
- `env/xdg.ts` - XDG base directory env vars
- `env/temp-dir.ts` - Temp directory env vars (TEMP, TMP, TMPDIR)
- `env/test.ts` - Test framework env vars (VITEST, JEST_WORKER_ID)

**Constants → Getter functions** - All env constants converted to functions:
```typescript
// Before (v1.x):
import { GITHUB_TOKEN } from '#env/github-token'

// After (v2.x):
import { getGithubToken } from '#env/github'
```

**Deleted files** - Removed 60+ individual env constant files:
- `env/github-token.ts`, `env/socket-api-token.ts`, etc. → Consolidated into grouped files
- `env/getters.ts` → Functions moved to their respective grouped files

### Added

**AsyncLocalStorage-Based Test Rewiring**

New `env/rewire.ts` and `path/rewire.ts` modules provides context-isolated environment variable overrides for testing:

```typescript
import { withEnv, setEnv, resetEnv, getEnvValue } from '#env/rewire'

// Option 1: Isolated context with AsyncLocalStorage
await withEnv({ CI: '1', NODE_ENV: 'test' }, async () => {
  // CI env var is '1' only within this block
  // Concurrent tests don't interfere
})

// Option 2: Traditional beforeEach/afterEach pattern
beforeEach(() => {
  setEnv('CI', '1')
})

afterEach(() => {
  resetEnv()
})
```

**Features:**
- Allows toggling between snapshot and live behavior
- Compatible with `vi.stubEnv()` as fallback

### Changed

- Updated all dynamic `require()` statements to use path aliases (`#constants/*`, `#packages/*`)
- Improved logger blank line tracking per stream (separate stderr/stdout tracking)
- Exported `getCacache()` function for external use

## [1.3.6](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v1.3.6) - 2025-10-26

### Fixed

- Fixed `debug` module functions being incorrectly tree-shaken as no-ops in bundled output
  - Removed incorrect `/*@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__*/` annotations from `debug()`, `debugDir()`, `debugLog()`, and their `*Ns` variants
  - These functions have side effects (logging output, spinner manipulation) and should not be removed by bundlers
  - Fixes issue where `debugLog()` and `debugDir()` were compiled to empty no-op functions

## [1.3.5](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v1.3.5) - 2025-10-26

### Added

- Added `createEnvProxy()` utility function to `env` module for Windows-compatible environment variable access
  - Provides case-insensitive environment variable access (e.g., PATH, Path, path all work)
  - Smart priority system: overrides > exact match > case-insensitive fallback
  - Full Proxy implementation with proper handlers for get, set, has, ownKeys, getOwnPropertyDescriptor
  - Opt-in helper for users who need Windows env var compatibility
  - Well-documented with usage examples and performance notes
- Added `findCaseInsensitiveEnvKey()` utility function to `env` module
  - Searches for environment variable keys using case-insensitive matching
  - Optimized with length fast path to minimize expensive `toUpperCase()` calls
  - Useful for cross-platform env var access where case may vary (e.g., PATH vs Path vs path)
- Added comprehensive test suite for `env` module with 71 tests
  - Covers `envAsBoolean()`, `envAsNumber()`, `envAsString()` conversion utilities
  - Tests `createEnvProxy()` with Windows environment variables and edge cases
  - Validates `findCaseInsensitiveEnvKey()` optimization and behavior

### Fixed

- Fixed `spawn` module to preserve Windows `process.env` Proxy behavior
  - When no custom environment variables are provided, use `process.env` directly instead of spreading it
  - Preserves Windows case-insensitive environment variable access (PATH vs Path)
  - Fixes empty CLI output issue on Windows CI runners
  - Only spreads `process.env` when merging custom environment variables

## [1.3.4](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v1.3.4) - 2025-10-26

### Added

- Added Node.js SIGUSR1 signal handler prevention utilities in `constants/node` module
  - `supportsNodeDisableSigusr1Flag()`: Detects if Node supports `--disable-sigusr1` flag (v22.14+, v23.7+, v24.8+)
  - `getNodeDisableSigusr1Flags()`: Returns appropriate flags to prevent debugger attachment
    - Returns `['--disable-sigusr1']` on supported versions (prevents Signal I/O Thread creation)
    - Falls back to `['--no-inspect']` on Node 18+ (blocks debugger but still creates thread)
  - Enables production CLI environments to prevent SIGUSR1 debugger signal handling for security

## [1.3.3](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v1.3.3) - 2025-10-24

### Fixed

- Fixed lazy getter bug in `objects` module where `defineGetter`, `defineLazyGetter`, and `defineLazyGetters` had incorrect `/*@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__*/` annotations
  - These functions mutate objects by defining properties, so marking them as side-effect-free caused esbuild to incorrectly tree-shake the calls during bundling
  - Lazy getters were returning `undefined` instead of their computed values
  - Removed double wrapping in `defineLazyGetters` where `createLazyGetter` was being called unnecessarily

## [1.3.2](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-lib/releases/tag/v1.3.2) - 2025-10-24
